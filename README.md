# Oxford-API
## Installation guide
Go to the [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page of Python and download the latest version of Python 3 of your operating system.  

Then, execute the following commands, one-by-one, to install:  
```
git clone https://github.com/datthinh1801/Oxford-API.git
cd Oxford-API
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

Another option is to go to the [release](https://github.com/datthinh1801/Oxford-API/releases) tab of this repository and download the latest version.

> **For non-tech user:** In order to create a vocabulary list from a file, you need to copy that file into the directory (folder) of this tool.

### Examples
#### Reading new vocabs from a file
I have a file (named `input.txt` residing in the same directory of this tool) containing my new vocabulary as followed:  
```
inquire
insist
straightforward
sort out
```

I want the results to be written to another file called `output.txt` which resides in the same directory of this tool. The command will be:  
Windows:
```
py oxford_api.py -f input.txt -o output.txt
```  

Linux:
```
python3 oxford_api.py -f input.txt -o output.txt
```  

> You don't need to create the `output.txt` file beforehand. This tool will do it for you.

#### Reading new vocabs directly on console
Windows:
```
py oxford_api.py -w "inquire, insist, straightforward, sort out" -o output.txt
```

Linux:
```
python3 oxford_api.py -w "inquire, insist, straightforward, sort out" -o output.txt
```  

The output file will be:
```
inquire|(verb) ask for information from someone
e.g. he inquired about cottages for sale

insist|(verb) demand something forcefully, not accepting refusal
e.g. she insisted on carrying her own bag

straightforward|(adjective) uncomplicated and easy to do or understand
e.g. in a straightforward case no fees will be charged

sort_out|(verb) arrange things systematically in groups or according to type
e.g. she sorted out the clothes, some to be kept, some to be thrown away

```

- Create a new study set (or add to an existing one).
