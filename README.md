## Usage
```
usage: oxlet.py [-h] [-w [WORDS]] [-f [INFILE]] [-o [OUTFILE]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w [WORDS], --words [WORDS]
                        a list of words/phrases separated by commas (e.g. sustainable, take a toll)
  -f [INFILE], --file [INFILE]
                        the name of the file to read from (e.g. newwords.txt)
  -o [OUTFILE], --output [OUTFILE]
                        the filename to write the results to (e.g. output.txt)
```  

### Examples
#### Read new words from a file
I have a file (named `input.txt` residing in the same directory of this tool) containing my new words as follows:  
```
inquire
insist
straightforward
sort out
```

I want the results to be written to another file called `output.txt` which resides in the same directory of this tool. The command will be:  
Windows:
```
py oxlet.py -f input.txt -o output.txt
```  

Linux/MacOS:
```
python3 oxlet.py -f input.txt -o output.txt
```  

> You don't need to create the `output.txt` file beforehand. This tool will do it for you.

#### Read new words directly
Windows:
```
py oxlet.py -w "inquire, insist, straightforward, sort out" -o output.txt
```

Linux/MacOS:
```
python3 oxlet.py -w "inquire, insist, straightforward, sort out" -o output.txt
```  

The output file will be:
```
inquire|(verb) ask for information from someone
e.g. he inquired about cottages for sale

insist|(verb) demand something forcefully, not accepting refusal
e.g. she insisted on carrying her own bag

straightforward|(adjective) uncomplicated and easy to do or understand
e.g. in a straightforward case no fees will be charged

sort_out|(verb) arrange things systematically in groups or according to type
e.g. she sorted out the clothes, some to be kept, some to be thrown away

```

## Integrate to Quizlet
This tool uses `|` as the separator between the terminology and the definition, `\n\n` (a blank line) between 2 different words. Therefore, if you are about to use this output file for [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest), you should do as the followings:
- Create a new study set (or add to an existing one).
