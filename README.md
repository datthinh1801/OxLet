## Usage
```
usage: oxlet.py [-h] [-w [WORDS]] [-f [INFILE]] [-o [OUTFILE]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w [WORDS], --words [WORDS]
                        a list of words/phrases separated by commas (e.g. sustainable, take a toll)
  -f [INFILE], --file [INFILE]
                        the name of the file to read from (e.g. newwords.txt)
  -o [OUTFILE], --output [OUTFILE]
                        the filename to write the results to (e.g. output.txt)
```  

### Parameters explaination
| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-w` | A list of words that you want to look up. Every 2 words shoud be separated by a comma or a comma followed by a space and all word must be enclosed in a pair of quotes _(either single quotes `' '` or double quotes `" "` are ok)_. |
| `-f` | Specify the name of the input file containing your new words. |
| `-o` | Specify the name of the output file. |  

> **Note that:** `-o` is required while only one of the `-w` and the `-f` should be selected at a time.   

### Format of the input file (if used)
#### File extension
The input file should be a text file (`.txt`) for the best performance.  
#### File format
The format of the contents of the input file should be **one word per line** or **one phrase per line**, and no separators such as `,` or `.` is required.  

For example:  
```
inquire
insist
straightforward
sort out
```

## Examples
### Read new words from a file
I have a file (named `input.txt` residing in the same directory of this tool) containing my new words as follows:  
```
inquire
insist
straightforward
sort out
```

I want the results to be written to another file called `output.txt` which resides in the same directory of this tool. The command will be:  
Windows:
```
py oxlet.py -f input.txt -o output.txt
```  

Linux/MacOS:
```
python3 oxlet.py -f input.txt -o output.txt
```  

> You don't need to create the `output.txt` file beforehand. This tool will do it for you.

### Read new words directly
Windows:
```
py oxlet.py -w "inquire, insist, straightforward, sort out" -o output.txt
```

Linux/MacOS:
```
python3 oxlet.py -w "inquire, insist, straightforward, sort out" -o output.txt
```  

The output file will be:
```
inquire|(verb) ask for information from someone
e.g. he inquired about cottages for sale

insist|(verb) demand something forcefully, not accepting refusal
e.g. she insisted on carrying her own bag

straightforward|(adjective) uncomplicated and easy to do or understand
e.g. in a straightforward case no fees will be charged

sort_out|(verb) arrange things systematically in groups or according to type
e.g. she sorted out the clothes, some to be kept, some to be thrown away

```  

### Demo
This demo reads new words from a file but you can feed new words to the tool directly using the `-w` followed by a doubly-quoted string of your new words like the above example.

#### MacOS

> **Note that:** You only need to run the `pip install -r requirements.txt` at the first time you download the tool. In following times, you just need to run the `python3 oxlet.py

## Integrate to Quizlet
This tool uses `|` as the separator between the terminology and the definition, `\n\n` (a blank line) between 2 different words. Therefore, if you are about to use this output file for [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest), you should do as the followings:
- Create a new study set (or add to an existing one).

- Finally, copy the whole contents of the `output.txt` to the textbox in Quizlet and you are done!
